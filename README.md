# ERC20 Cairo contract Unit Testing
Some unit tests and integration testing of the ERC20 Cairo contract, based on https://github.com/robertkodra/basecamp_04_demo. 

Run the whole repository with `scarb run test` and execute all tests.

This was tested with Cairo v1.1.0. For other versions, the Scarb.toml may have to be adjusted.
